## The Variety Food Truck Ordering System - Python Challenge

### Overview
This project is an interactive ordering system for The Variety Food Truck, built using Python. The program allows customers to browse through a menu, place their orders, and receive a printed receipt with the total price of all items ordered.

The main file in this repository is [menu.py](https://github.com/jsaintfleur/python-challenge-1/blob/main/menu.py), which contains the Python code for running the ordering system.

### Features
- A menu with various categories such as **Snacks**, **Meals**, **Drinks**, and **Dessert**.
- **Input validation** for selecting menu items and quantities.
- The ability to place multiple orders and receive a receipt at the end.
- Calculates the **total cost** of all items ordered.
- Option to **modify or remove** items from the order.

### File Structure
- `menu.py`: This file contains the main logic for the ordering system, including the menu, input prompts, order processing, and receipt generation.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jsaintfleur/python-challenge-1.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd python-challenge-1
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python menu.py
    ```

### How It Works
1. The program starts by greeting the customer and presenting the main menu categories.
2. The customer selects a category and then chooses an item from that category.
3. The customer inputs the quantity they wish to order.
4. The system prompts whether the customer wants to continue ordering, modify the order, or proceed to checkout.
5. Once the customer finishes ordering, a receipt with all items and their total cost is printed.
